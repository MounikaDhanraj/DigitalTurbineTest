# DigitalTurbineTest

This project consumes the data from the api and displays the scrolling list of ads . 
On Clicking the ad , it goes to the details screen.

Used Retrofit, Okhttp libraries to consume the rest api and picaso for displaying images. 
Followed MVVM design pattern for this app .
Used kotlin co-routines for asynchronus programming.

Future Works:

Make it as a single activity with two fragments in tabbed layout.

Improve the UI look and feel of the app.
